Furthermore, we wanted to see how the arrival of the new investors brought PSG to another dimension on every field. Indeed, PSG developed in almost every field thinking of marketing, digital or even international communication. Through this study, we would like to analyze the evolution of the financial states of PSG and try to explain how they managed to become the first financial power in the fooball business in February 2020. Furthermore, we would like to predict the evolution of theses financial states for the next years.
