The Paris Saint Germain club was created in 1970. the club has known many owners since its creation. During their first years, PSG was fan owned until 1973. Then from 1973 to 1991, the club was acquired by a group of french wealthly businessmen who were led by two of the most importants presidents in the history of the club called Daniel Hechter and Francis Borelli. Then Canal + owned PSG which led them to a very good period in their history until 2006. From 2006 to 2011, an american corporation invested in PSG afterwards. Since 2011, PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investments.

Being fans of Paris Saint Germain since our childhood, we wanted to analyze the company's financial health since 2006. Furthermore, we wanted to see how the arrival of the new investors brought PSG to another dimension on every field. Indeed, PSG developed in almost every field thinking of marketing, digital or even international communication. Through this study, we would like to analyze the evolution of the financial states of PSG and try to explain how they managed to become the first financial power in the fooball business in February 2020. Furthermore, we would like to predict the evolution of theses financial states for the next years.


## The dataset 
This dataset was scrapped using Selenium library on a website where we can find all of PSG's financial statements. Nevertheless, some lines of the financial statements were not ope source that's why values don't exactly match the results. Financial statements are published every year since 2006 and retrace the balance sheet at the end of each season. We made the study on the data since 2006.  
On the repositery, we can find  3 datasets : 
* The first one concerns the assets (current assets, total property, net fixed assets, ect ...)
* The second one concerns liabilities or stock holder's equity (expenses, debts, accounts payable, taxes, ect ...)
* The third one represents the results at the end of the year (sales revenue, production, value added, wage bill, staff, ect ...)
